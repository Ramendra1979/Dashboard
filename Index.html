          ever before. Whether it is for personal use at home or business use at
          our place of employment, we rely on our electronic devices to keep us

          Mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) are specialized for a
          specific set of devices. By default, they don't offer you complete
          access to your system hardware (Administrator or "root" access). They
          also have stricter hardware requirements because the ecosystem of
          mobile apps and devices is strongly connected to specific hardware
          features. In other words, you can't run the newest apps on an older
          mobile OS, and the newest mobile OS won't run on a significantly older
          device.

        <h1>What is a mobile device?</h1>
        <p>
          A mobile device is a general term for any type of handheld computer.
          These devices are designed to be extremely portable, and they can
          often fit in your hand. Some mobile devices—like tablets, e-readers,
          and smartphones—are powerful enough to do many of the same things you
          can do with a desktop or laptop computer. Like laptops, tablet
          computers are designed to be portable. However, they provide a
          different computing experience.

          our place of employment, we rely on our electronic devices to keep us

          basis are smartphones, tablets, and laptops. All three of these
          devices are portable, which allows us to deal with our personal and
          work lives from anywhere in the world. Each device serves a purpose
          for specific occupations, and we will dive into some of those examples
          below.
